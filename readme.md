# MSc Thesis

## Community Finding in Phylogenetic Trees using PHYLOViZ Online

The aim of the thesis was to develop an improved version of [PHYLOViZ](http://www.phyloviz.net/) Online by
implementing community finding algorithms, as well as, adding new tools for
data visualization. Similar algorithms are being used in other domains. In
phylogenetics, it is a step forward for handling infectious diseases.

This tool is intended to assist distinct health professionals, including doctors and
bioinformaticians, and is designed to enable medical and research purposes.

### Implemented Algorithms

1. Louvain;
2. Infomap;
3. Label Propagation;
4. Weighted Label Propagation;
5. Layered Label Propagation;

### Benchmark

Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection

### Visualization Interface

Cytoscape.js

### Status

[21/12/2018] Louvain algorithm implemented;

[13/01/2019] Label Propagation, Weighted Label Propagation and Layered Label Propagation algorithms implemented.

[16/01/2019] Infomap algorithm implemented;
